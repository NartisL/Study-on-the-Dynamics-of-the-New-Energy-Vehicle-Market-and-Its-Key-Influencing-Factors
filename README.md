# Study-on-the-Dynamics-of-the-New-Energy-Vehicle-Market-and-Its-Key-Influencing-Factors
This study selects data from four aspects—policy, economy, technology, and market—and employs various methods including Spearman correlation analysis, ridge regression, grey prediction, and Granger causality tests to conduct exploratory analyses of the data, investigating the impact of different factors on the development of new energy vehicles (NEVs) and forecasting future trends.
Key Findings
•	After principal component analysis and data transformation, eleven indicators were ultimately selected for analysis. Based on the Spearman correlation coefficient, the importance of the data indicators was tested, a ridge regression model was established to solve the regression equation, and the impact of different factors on NEV development was explored.
•	According to the results of the correlation analysis, four indicators that were most closely related to NEV development from 2013 to 2022 were selected: NEV holding ratio, market size, the number of charging piles, and market penetration rate. A fusion model based on polynomial regression and grey prediction was established for forecasting. The results indicated that the development trend of China’s NEVs will be favorable over the next decade, with all four indicators showing an upward trend.
•	A model based on Granger causality testing was established to analyze the impact of domestic NEV market dynamics on the global traditional energy automotive industry. Using linear regression models and the Spearman correlation coefficient, it was analyzed that the rise in national NEV sales may lead to a decline in global sales of traditional energy vehicles, an increase in global oil prices, and the promotion of traditional energy technology R&D.
